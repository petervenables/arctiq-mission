# arctiq-mission

## Summary

This project is simply for my own use in learning how to use terraform, GKE, and github actions to automate the deployment of a microservice into GCP. 

## Architecture

This project deploys the microservices-demo to Google Cloud Platform using github actions. 

## Credits

The microservices-demo is not mine (naturally). I pulled this into my project so I could have a sufficiently complicated service to deploy. The code comes from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.
